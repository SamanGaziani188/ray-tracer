# Ray Tracing Engine

## Purpose

This project sets the foundation of an extendable ray tracing engine using principles of Object Oriented design. It implements some of the ray tracing topics, namely:

- tracing a ray through a scene
- sampling a scene
- perspective and parallel projection
- ray-primitive intersections

## Background

For this project, you must know

- how to read and write object oriented code in C++
- how to compile a C++ project spanning multiple files in multiple directories
- vector arithmetic
